# Metronome app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my solution to the task set for me by Practice Pal to create a simple metronome app that includes a 'tap tempo' feature.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The app will also be deployed and a link will be provided
